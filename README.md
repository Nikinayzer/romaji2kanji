**Romaji2Kanji** is a user-friendly web app designed to help Japanese language learners practice writing Hiragana and Katakana symbols. Its interactive exercises make learning Japanese symbols easier and more enjoyable, whenever it's transforming symbols to their romanian representation or vice versa.

## Why This Project Exists

</p>

The idea for Romaji2Kanji arose from my personal need for an effective tool to practice writing Japanese symbols. As a Japanese language learner, I encountered a lack of resources for this aspect of learning. This project was created to address this gap and provide a learning tool for students like myself who want to improve their proficiency in Japanese reading and writing.

## Features
- **Keyboard Support**: On-screen keyboard for easy input.

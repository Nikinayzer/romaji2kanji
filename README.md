## About This Project

**Romaji2Kanji** is a web application designed to make learning Japanese symbols (Hiragana and Katakana) easier for Japanese language students. By providing a platform to practice writing words with these symbols, the project aims to enhance the learning experience and proficiency of learners.

## Why This Project Exists

The idea for Romaji2Kanji arose from my personal need for an effective tool to practice writing Japanese symbols. As a Japanese language learner, I encountered a lack of resources tailored specifically to this aspect of learning. This project was created to address this gap and provide a valuable learning tool for students like myself who want to improve their proficiency in Japanese writing.

## Introduction
